# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
As a data analysis for Pyber, a Python based ride-sharing app company, valued at $2.3 billion. I have been assigned to a new   project by CEO V. Isualize to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a summery DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type.

Further, Pandas and Matplotlib have been used to create multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

### Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

#### Summery dataframe  for ride sharing data among different city types.

  - Considering above dataframe we can say follwing.
   -  City type "Rural" has minimum Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares comparing to othger two city types. 
   -  City type "Urban" has highest number of Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares.   
   -  The Average Fare per Ride is concerned, the "Rural" city type has the highest fare ($34.62) while "Urban" has the lowest ($24.53). The differance is slightly over than $10 between Rual and urban city types. Average Fare per Ride differance between Rural and Suburban is $3.65 while observed $6.44 differance between Suburban and Urban.
   -	The Average Fare per Drivers is concerned, the lowest fare is for "Urban" ($16.57) and highest is for "Rural" ($55.49). The Average Fare per Driver value for Rural is little over 3 times higher than "Urban".

#### Multiple line chart for weekly fare (from Jan Apr) among different city types

 - At glance in line chart, considering all 3 city types, "Urban" cities has highest Total Fares and "Rural" cities has the lowest.
 - For all 3 City Types, from the beginning of February 3rd week to 4th week, the Total Fares shows continous rising and reached its peak value.
 - For the  City Type "Urban", the lowest Total Fares reported on end of the 3rd week of April.
 - For the  City Type "Suburban", the lowest Total Fares reported on end of the 1st week of April. 
 - For the  City Type "Rural", the lowest Total Fares reported on end of the 1st week of January.  

## Summery
 - Driver to Rides ratio is higest in "Rural", so increse the number of drivers in Rural city type.
 - There is over $10 diffance between Average Fare per Ride in Urban and Rural, so recomanded to increase the formular to calculate ride fare for Urban cities. Since Urban cities having the higest nuber of rides, the company profit can be incresed dramatically.   
 - Average Fare per Ride is highest in Rural, but do we do see that its having least number of rides, so recomanding to do some marcketing/promotion campagins in Rural cirites to increase total rides, so it helps to increase company profit.
