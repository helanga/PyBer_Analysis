# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
As a data analysis for Pyber, a Python based ride-sharing app company, valued at $2.3 billion. I have been assigned to a new   project by CEO V. Isualize to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a summery DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type.

Further, Pandas and Matplotlib will be used to create multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

### Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
