# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
As a data analysis for Pyber, a Python based ride-sharing app company, valued at $2.3 billion. I have been assigned to a new   project by CEO V. Isualize to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create a summery DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type.

Further, Pandas and Matplotlib will be used to create multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results

### Differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types

#### Summery dataframe  for ride sharing data among different city types.

  - Considering above data frame we can say city types among Total rides, Total Drivers and total fares.Rural city type has minimum total rides, total drivers and total fares. But the urban cities have higher number of total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares. Suburban is in between rural and urban.
  -	If we consider city types among Average fare per ride, it doesnâ€™t show big difference, but the rural cities have minimum average fare per ride and urban has maximum $34.62 ad suburban is in between with $30.97.
  -	In average fare per driver column, we can see Rural cities has maximum average fare per driver ($55.49) and suburban cities has $39.50 and Urban shows with very less amount ($16.57) comparing with other two city types

#### Multiple line chart for weekly fare (from Jan Apr) among different city types

 - At glance in line chart, we can say urban cities has highest fare and rural cities has lowest fares with each weeks peaks or drops.
 - Considering all 3 city types we can say beginning of February 3rd week all 3 city types has highest ride fare.

## Summery
 - Not enough total drivers in rural cities considering total rides vs drivers.
 - When considering total rides and drivers we can see there is not enough drivers for rural cities.
 - Better to decrease average fare per Driver amount in rural cities and increase the number of drivers
